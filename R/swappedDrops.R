#' @details
#' Barcode swapping on the Illumina sequencer occurs when multiplexed samples undergo PCR re-amplification on the flow cell by excess primer with different barcodes.
#' This results in sequencing of the wrong sample barcode and molecules being assigned to incorrect samples after debarcoding.
#' With droplet data, there is the opportunity to remove such effects based on the combination of gene, UMI and cell barcode for each observed transcript molecule.
#' It is very unlikely that the same combination will arise from different molecules in multiple samples.
#' Thus, observation of the same combination across multiple samples is indicative of barcode swapping.
#' 
#' We can remove swapped molecules based on the number of reads assigned to each gene-UMI-barcode combination.
#' From the total number of reads assigned to that combination, the fraction of reads in each sample is calculated.
#' The sample with the largest fraction that is greater than \code{min.frac} is defined as the putative sample of origin to which the molecule is assigned.
#' This assumes that the swapping rate is low, so the sample of origin for a molecule should contain the majority of the reads.
#' In other all samples, reads for the combination are assumed to derive from swapping and do not contribute to the count matrix.
#' Setting \code{min.frac=1} will effectively remove all molecules that appear in multiple samples.
#' We do not recommend setting \code{min.frac} lower than 0.5.
#' 
#' If \code{diagnostics=TRUE}, a diagnostics matrix is returned containing the number of reads per gene-UMI-barcode combination in each sample.
#' Each row corresponds to a combination and each column corresponds to a sample.
#' This can be useful for examining the level of swapping across samples on a molecule-by-molecule basis, 
#' though for the sake of memory, the actual identity of the molecules is not returned.
#' By default, the matrix is returned as a \linkS4class{HDF5Matrix}, which reduces memory usage and avoids potential issues with integer overflow.
#' If \code{hdf5.out=FALSE}, a sparse matrix is returned instead, which is faster but uses more memory.
#' 
#' \code{swappedDrops} is a wrapper around \code{removeSwappedDrops} that extracts the relevant data from the 10X Genomics molecule information file.
#' For other types of droplet-based data, it may be more convenient to call \code{removeSwappedDrops} directly.
#' 
#' @return 
#' A list is returned with the \code{cleaned} entry, itself a list of sparse matrices.
#' Each matrix corresponds to a sample and contains the UMI count for each gene (row) and cell barcode (column) after removing swapped molecules.
#' All cell barcodes that were originally observed are reported as columns, though note that it is possible for some barcodes to contain no counts.
#' 
#' If \code{get.swapped=TRUE}, a \code{swapped} entry is returned in the top-level list.
#' This is a list containing sample-specific sparse matrices of UMI counts corresponding to the swapped molecules.
#' Adding the cleaned and swapped matrices for each sample should yield the total UMI count prior to removal of swapped molecules. 
#' 
#' If \code{get.diagnostics=TRUE}, the top-level list will also contain an additional \code{diagnostics} matrix.
#' 
#' @section Format of the molecule information file:
#' \code{swappedDrops} makes a few assumptions about the nature of the data in each molecule information file.
#' These are necessary to simplify downstream processing and are generally acceptable in most cases.
#' 
#' Each molecule information file should contain data from only a single 10X run.
#' Users should \emph{not} combine multiple samples into a single molecule information file.
#' The function will emit a warning upon detecting multiple GEM groups from any molecule information file.
#' Molecules with different GEM groups will not be recognised as coming from a different sample, though they will be recognised as being derived from different cell-level libraries.
#' 
#' In files produced by CellRanger version 3.0, an additional per-molecule field is present indicating the (c)DNA library from which the molecule was derived.
#' Library preparation can be performed separately for different features (e.g., antibodies, CRISPR tags) such that one 10X run can contain data from multiple libraries.
#' This allows for arbitrarily complicated multiplexing schemes - for example, gene expression libraries might be multiplexed together across one set of samples,
#' while the antibody-derived libraries might be multiplexed across another \emph{different} set of samples.
#' For simplicity, we assume that multiplexing was performed across the same set of \code{samples} for all libraries therein.
#'
#' If a different multiplexing scheme was applied for each library type, users can set \code{use.library} to only check for swapping within a given library type(s).
#' For example, if the multiplexed set of samples for the gene expression libraries is different from the multiplexed set for the CRISPR libraries,
#' one could run \code{swappedDrops} separately on each set of samples with \code{use.library} set to the corresponding type. 
#' This avoids having to take the union of both sets of samples for a single \code{swappedDrops} run,
#' which could detect spurious swaps between samples that were never multiplexed together for the same library type.
